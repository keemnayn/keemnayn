## Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Nayeon Kim

I am an aspiring backend developer dedicated to creating IT services that truly satisfy users. 

Hereâ€™s how I work towards this goal:

 - **Focusing on Core Values**: I concentrate on building what Iâ€™m passionate about, designing software with a flexible structure that
   makes it easy to add features users want.\
 - **Deep Understanding of Java and Spring**: I primarily work with Java and the Spring framework, leveraging my deep knowledge to build stable and scalable backend systems.
 - **Continuous Learning**: I consistently read, understand, and apply knowledge from reputable books and references, integrating it into my projects.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my approach!
